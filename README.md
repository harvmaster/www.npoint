# NPoint (npoint)
A project documentation tool that can be used to document and test the endpoints of REST APIs.
Check out current developement build [here](https://www.npoint.mc.hzuccon.com/#)

## Todo
- Build out frontend to create and display endpoints
- Provide REST API that allows the Project's endpoints to be stored
- Provide user Auth
- Static code analysis / Typescript importing to allow for faster documentation
- Implement browser based testing of the endpoints along with "flows" which will allow users to chain endpoints together ( Auth -> getUserData -> createSomeProperty )

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```
